# @mathias 's NaNoGenMo 2018

Roughly: The idea this year is to generate a "journey" novel in the spirit of The Wizard of Oz or The Hobbit, with some absurd elements inspired by Alice in Wonderland and other novels meant more for kids than adults.

## Dev Diary

In [this issue](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2018/issues/59) on the NaNoGenMo 2018 repo.

## Local setup

1. Clone https://github.com/dariusk/corpora to the root dir
2. Run ~with seed~: (TODO: seeding with particular seed)

```
$ node index.js
```

Book will be generated in book.txt and book.pdf
